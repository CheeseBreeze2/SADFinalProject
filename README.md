# SADFinalProject
Final Project for my Systems Analysis and Design class.
This is a prototype website for the Panther Hotel created using Python and Flask.
The website will include 4 pages having a:
welcome page, reservation page, confirmation page. and a reservation list
Also I used Pitt Gold as the accent color, but it kind of looks like peach. At least the Pitt Royal as the main color looks nice. These colors were taken from the Pitt palette of colors.
